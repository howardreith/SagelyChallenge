# Sagely Skills Assessment

Hello! We're happy you're here. **Thank you** for taking the time to apply at Sagely.

Sagely is a unique company for individuals who love learning, problem-solving, and helping grow others while building impactful products. As a Software Engineering Sage, you will have ample opportunity to explore new value-add features of our flagship product, the Sagely App. As part of 
our hiring process, we ask that you complete a skills assessment. We want this assessment to be as painless and transparent as possible. We avoid whiteboarding sessions and quizzes on implementing red-black trees. Instead, we opt to provide a real-world scenario and a small project for you to complete.

### Project Details

This document contains a set of requirements, and the project is to deliver the code necessary to fulfill these requirements. If anything seems ambiguous, state your understanding in your README.md, or inline comments along with your solution.

### Scenario

Your mission is simple; create a web application that displays a database of content items. At Sagely, our goal is to curate a learning path for anyone who is looking to grow their skills, part of that is delivering that content to our users. In practice, our application is written using the mobile app development framework Flutter, but because we're relatively new, we have a need for a reasonably varied skillset. We feel like the development of a simple data-backed website cuts a pretty good cross-section of that skillset without being overly cumbersome. We're asking for a few deliverables:

#### Deliverables

* A web application that:
  * Displays a set of content based on the data within `dataset.csv`. How you decide to render this content is entirely up to you.
  * Allows a user to select a specific piece of content to view details about that content on a separate page.

#### What we're looking for

  * Your solution must render all items in the dataset to display (at least) the content's title.
  * Your solution must provide a method of viewing detailed information about a piece of content.
  * Your solution must have documentation explaining how to setup a local instance of the application
  * Your solution must have documentation explaining any data preparation or transformation if applicable to run the application.
  * Your solution should include tests. The framework you use to do this is up to you.

While the technical execution of this assessment is important, be prepared to walk us through some of the design and architectural decisions you decided to make along the way. We value effective communication highly, and are interested in how you're able to present this solution to us should we follow-up.

Once you're done, email us a link to the git repository containing your completed solution. If private, make sure you allow access from our `sagelycareers` GitHub account.
